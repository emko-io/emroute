# Project Setup

emroute works on Bun, Node, and Deno. Pick your runtime:

- **[Setup with Bun](./01a-setup-bun.md)** — native TypeScript, Bun-optimized runtime
- **[Setup with Node](./01b-setup-node.md)** — compiled JS, no extra loaders for emroute
- **[Setup with Deno](./01c-setup-deno.md)** — native TypeScript, node: compatibility

Each guide walks you through install, first route, and running the server.
