Generate sitemap.xml from route manifest

The route generator already knows all route patterns. It could generate a
sitemap.xml alongside routes.manifest.ts as a static file served by the dev
server.

URLs should point to /html/ prefixed routes — SSR HTML gives crawlers real
HTML without JS execution. With the planned data prefetch/hydration feature,
these would be full page snapshots, much more valuable for SEO.

Scope:

- Static routes (no :param) can be listed directly
- Dynamic routes (/projects/:id) would need a data source to enumerate actual
  URLs, or be excluded. Could accept an optional async function per dynamic
  route that returns the list of valid params.
- Output: standard sitemap.xml with <loc>, <lastmod>, <changefreq>, <priority>
- Generated by the route generator alongside the manifest
- Served as a static file at /sitemap.xml by the dev server

Open questions:

- How to handle lastmod? File modification time of the .page.* file?
- Should priority/changefreq be configurable per route (e.g., via frontmatter
  or a .sitemap.ts companion file)?
- Should dynamic route enumeration be a build-time hook or runtime?

Postponed: feature is well-defined but not a priority for beta.
