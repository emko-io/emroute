# v1.0.0 Release Blockers — ALL RESOLVED

All blockers resolved in v1.0.0-beta.6.

---

## 1. ~~`parseAttrsToParams` ignores single-quoted, unquoted, and boolean attributes~~ — RESOLVED

**Source:** `issues/issues-1.0.0-beta.5.md` — Issue #11

Extended the regex to support single-quoted (`attr='value'`), unquoted
(`attr=value`), and boolean (`disabled`) attributes. Function also exported
for direct testing.

---

## 2. ~~`resolveWidgetTags` self-closing syntax diverges from HTML spec~~ — RESOLVED

**Source:** `issues/issues-1.0.0-beta.5.md` — Issue #12

Removed the self-closing alternative from the regex. Only paired tags
(`<widget-foo></widget-foo>`) are now resolved, aligning SSR with the HTML
spec.

---

## 3. ~~SPA router intercepts SSR links~~ — RESOLVED

**Source:** `issues/spa-intercepts-ssr-links.issue.md`

Added a guard in the click handler: links with `/html/` or `/md/` pathnames
skip SPA interception and trigger full page navigation.

---

## 4. ~~SSR markdown emits useless `router-slot` placeholder for leaf pages~~ — RESOLVED

**Source:** `issues/md-router-slot-placeholder.issue.md`

`renderRouteContent` now returns empty string when the rendered markdown is
exactly the router-slot placeholder block. The existing `if (markdown)` guard
in `renderPage` skips it.
